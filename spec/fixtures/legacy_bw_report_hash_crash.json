  "main_desc": "I was riding westbound on Del Mar, when a car backed out of a driveway ahead of me.  I stopped in time to avoid colliding with the car, and paused to either allow them to pull back into the driveway, or to wait for traffic to clear so I could go around them, but the car continued backing up until making contact with my front wheel, and pushing against my bike.  Vehicle only stopped when I started banging on their trunk with my fist.  Driver exited the vehicle and yelled expletives at me, and I rode away, west on Del Mar.  Driver then got back into the vehicle, revved their engine, and passed me very close and very fast, cutting me off by turning right (north) onto Grand Oaks, with their rear wheel hopping up onto the curb in the process.  I continued west on Del Mar, and did not see the vehicle or driver again.  Car was a white two-door with a spoiler (which is what I banged on).  Driver was hispanic male, around 30 years old.",

  "lessons_desc": "Driver was backing out of their driveway into the parking \\\"lane\\\", and did not anticipate the possibility of cyclists being there (despite the road being a signed and designated bike route).  Had I been controlling the right-hand lane of Del Mar instead, there would have probably been no conflict."
